Different AI algorithms for different game purposes

## Tree search algorithms

[See code](tree_search_algorithms/code.c)

Some tree search algorithms to solve a fifteen puzzle game such as :
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- Depth limited search
- Iterative deepening search
- A* algorithm

## MinMax and AlphaBeta algorithms

[See code](minmax_alphabeta_algorithms/aima-python-master/games.py)

AI using MinMax and AlphaBeta algorithms to play to Tic Tac Toe and, by extension, m,n,k-game.

## Wordle solver

[See code](wordle_solver/rep.pl)

AI that solves the wordle game using a bank of (french) words previously sorted by effectivness with the Information Theory algorithm.
